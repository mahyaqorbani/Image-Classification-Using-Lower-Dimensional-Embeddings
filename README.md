# Image-Classification-Using-Lower-Dimensional-Embeddings
Image classification has been a hot topic for several
decades. In this project, The objective is to evaluate
the efficacy of various classification algorithms on a
dataset comprising images of different bird species, segmented
into five distinct classes. The study began with
the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
algorithm on the original, high-dimensional dataset
to establish a baseline for classification performance.
To explore the impact of dimensionality reduction on
classification accuracy, Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding
(t-SNE) were applied to create lower-dimensional
embeddings of the data. Subsequently, the KNN algorithm
was employed on these reduced datasets. A comparative
analysis was performed to assess the variations
in KNN’s performance with and without dimensionality
reduction. In addition to KNN, a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model was applied to the original
image data. The performance of the CNN model
was found to be markedly superior to that of KNN,
both on the original and dimension-reduced datasets.
This highlighted CNN’s robustness in handling complex,
high-dimensional image data.
